Spicy Sesame Carrot Soup with Red Lentils;6;65;https://thefirstmess.com/2021/09/08/spicy-sesame-carrot-soup/#recipe;"1. Set a large soup pot over medium heat and pour in the olive oil. Swirl the oil around a bit and then add the onions to the pot and stir. The onions should be sizzling, but on the quieter end of sizzling. Lower the heat if necessary. Keep cooking the onions, stirring occasionally, until very soft and translucent (but not browning), about 7-8 minutes.

2. Add the ground cumin and coriander to the pot, along with the ground chillies as well. Stir and cook along with the onions for one full minute.

3. Then, add the minced garlic and ginger to the pot and stir. Keep cooking until the garlic is very fragrant, about 1 minute.

4. Add the carrots to the pot along with big pinches of salt and pepper. Stir the carrots to coat them in the spices and sautéed onions. Then, add the red lentils to the pot and stir once more. 

5. Finally, pour in the vegetable stock and give it a final stir. Bring this broth-y carrot, lentil, and spice mixture to a boil and then lower your heat to a simmer. Simmer this mixture uncovered, stirring here and there, until the carrots are quite soft, about 30 minutes.

6. Carefully ladle the broth-y carrot, lentil, and spice mixture into the pitcher of an upright, vented blender.

7. To this mixture, add the tahini, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Close the lid on the pitcher and slowly bring the speed of the blender up to high. You may have to add a few splashes of water to get things moving. Blend until you have a completely smooth puree.

8. Pour the spicy sesame carrot soup back into the pot. At this point, you can leave it as-is or add some water to make the texture a bit more fluid. I personally like a bit of fluidity in pureed soups, so I added 2 cups of water at this point. Bring the soup up to a boil, stirring often.

9. Stir in the lemon or lime juice.

10. Give the soup a taste at this point to see if you need to adjust some of the seasoning. Maybe it needs even more lemon/lime for your taste, some extra pepper etc. Adjust the seasoning to your liking and then serve! I topped mine with chopped cilantro, drizzles of tahini and chili oil, and sesame seeds."

Palak Paneer (Halloumi);4;30;https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-palak-paneer-with-curried-tofu/;"This recipe is all about multi-tasking and is totally doable in 30 minutes.
1. Start by preheating the oven to 218 C and cube your halloumi.
2. Add halloumi to a medium mixing bowl. Season with curry powder, coconut aminos, sea salt, and nutritional yeast. Shake the bowl to gently toss. Set aside.
3. Heat a medium oven-safe seasoned cast iron over medium heat. Once hot, add the halloumi and sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until a couple of the sides are browned. Then transfer to the hot oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Set aside to rest in the pan.
4. Fill a large pot halfway full with water and bring to a boil over high heat. While you wait, move on to the next step.
5. Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and cumin seed, ginger, onion, and jalapeno. Sauté until onion is soft and translucent — about 5 minutes.
6. Add diced tomatoes and garlic and stir to combine. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomato has softened.
7. Your water should be boiling now. Add spinach and cook uncovered for 2 minutes. Then strain and rinse with cold water. Drain well. Set aside.
8. Add the tomato mixture to a blender or food processor along with cooked drained spinach and the vegetable broth (or water). Blend into a smooth sauce, scraping down sides as needed. If it has trouble blending, add more vegetable broth or water.
9. Lastly, cook your sauce. Heat the same rimmed skillet from earlier over medium heat. Once hot, add remaining oil (or some water), curry powder, and garam masala. Stir and cook for 30 seconds.
10. Add the spinach sauce and stir. Cook the mixture over medium-low heat for about 3-4 minutes to deepen the flavors. If it bubbles too much, lower heat to a simmer. Then add coconut milk and stir.
11. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding salt or coconut aminos to deepen the flavor and curry powder for more rich curry flavor.
12. Serve over your halloumi and garnish with another drizzle of full fat coconut milk and fresh cilantro. Rice makes a lovely side, as does garlic naan!

Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or in a rimmed skillet until hot."

Crunchy Mexican Salad;4;;;"1. Preheat the oven to 230°C fan.
2. Place the sweetcorn in a large baking tray (with space for the seeds) with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and the cumin. Mix well and cook for 15 minutes until crispy. Mix the sunflower seeds with the paprika, and add them to the corn for the last 5 minutes of the cooking time.
3. While they cook, make the dressing and dip by placing the cashews in a food processor and pulsing until a smooth mixture forms - you may need to add a few tablespoons of the almond milk to help this along, it should take a minute or two. Once smooth, add the rest of the ingredients (1 avocado, lime juice, coriander, garlic), along with some salt, and pulse until smooth. You can add more almond milk depending on the consistency you like best.
4. Place the lettuce in a large mixing bowl, with the sweetcorn, sunflower seeds, avocado, tomatoes, coriander and a generous sprinkling of salt. Pour half the dressing over the salad and mix well.
Spoon the other half into a small bowl to use as a dip.
5. Divide the salad between plates and crush the tortilla chips over the top of each - do this right as you serve the salad so that they stay crunchy. Have a bowl of extra tortilla chips on the table to accompany the bowl of dip.

Green Quinoa Risotto;4;30;;"1. Put the onion and garlic into a saucepan over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and gently heat for about 5 minutes, until softened. The smaller you've cut the onion the quicker it'll cook, and the better it will mix into the quinoa.
2. Once the onion is soft, stir the quinoa into the mixture. Dissolve the stock cube in the boiling water then pour into the pan. Let the liquid come to the boil, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the quinoa is light and fluffy.
3. While the quinoa cooks, chop off the woody ends of the asparagus and slice the stems into rounds. Place in a frying pan with the courgette half-moons and a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and gently sauté on a medium heat, until soft.
4. Now make the pea purée. Put the frozen peas into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them for a couple of minutes, then drain and add to a blender with the lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, the mustard, almond milk, nutritional yeast, and some salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.

Pancakes;10;;https://culinarycartel.com/perfectly-simple-pancakes/;"1. Sift the dry ingredients together and make a well in the flour.
2. Mix wet ingredients together. Pour the wet ingredients into the well in the flour, and whisk until the batter is smooth. The butter might cool and leave a few buttery lumps in the batter – don’t stress about these, they will melt once cooked.
3. The batter should be the consistency of double cream/heavy cream. Add 2-3 tbsp more water if needed to loosen it up.
4. Cook on medium heat in a nonstick pan, coated with a knob of butter. I use a 30cm pan, and just over ¼ of a cup of batter per pancake – try to keep them as thin as you can manage.
5. Place the pancakes onto a plate then sprinkle over a generous amount of cinnamon, sugar and lemon juice. Keep stacking the pancakes up, adding more cinnamon, sugar and lemon juice between each layer. This will melt into the layers, making them extra delicious. Place the plate in a warmer or a low oven to keep nice and warm.
6. Serve them up as is, or add your own favourite toppings like berries and whipped cream."

Chocolate Chip Cookies;16;;https://bromabakery.com/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/;"Brown the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter begins to foam and turns a golden brown, emitting a nutty aroma. Make sure you only brown the butter lightly. When butter browns the liquid evaporates off which can dry out your dough. As soon as the butter starts to turn brown and smell nutty, take it off the heat to prevent any more liquid from escaping.  Take butter off the heat and allow to cool.

In a large mixing bowl combine the cooled brown butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat until mixed together. Add in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Mix well.

In separate bowl mix together the flour, salt and baking soda. Mix half the dry ingredients into the wet until everything comes together. Slowly add in the remaining flour a little bit at a time, stopping if the dough starts to get too dry.* Fold in the chocolate. Do not over mix.

Refrigerate the cookie dough for at least a half hour, or overnight.

When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Use a 1 ounce cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough out into balls, placing them 2 inches apart on the prepared sheet. Bake for 11 minutes, or until the edges are just golden brown and the centers have puffed up but are still gooey.  You could place cookie dough scoops in the freezer if you want to bake later (within 3 months).

Chimichurri Fish Tacos;4;30;https://camillestyles.com/food/the-chimichurri-fish-tacos-i-crave-all-summer/;"1. Make the chimichurri by combining everything (cilantro, parsley, paprika, red onion, garlic, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper) in a blender. It should be the consistency of a thick pourable sauce, so you may need to add a little more oil or a touch of hot water to thin it out.
2. First, the hake: cut it into strips, then toss in a bowl with 1/4 cup chimichurri until fish is coated. Refrigerate for at least an hour and up to 3 hours.
3. Toss the cabbage with a teaspoon or so of chimichurri, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.

Green Vegan Salad;4;40;https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/green-vegan-salad/#recipe-start;"1. Rinse quinoa well and place it in a small pot that you have a glass lid for. Add a few pinches of salt and 180 ml / ¾ cup of water, cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Once the water boils, decrease the heat to low-medium and let the quinoa simmer until all the water has been absorbed. To check, tilt the pot slightly, keeping the lid firmly on. If you see no water seeping out from under the grain, switch off the heat and let the quinoa sit (with the lid firmly on) for another 5-10 min to finish off cooking in its own steam. Cool it down completely.
2. Divide broccoli into small florets, snap wooden ends off the asparagus and cut zucchini into 0.5 cm / ¼” slices.
3. ROAST: Preheat the oven to 220° C / 428° F. Coat broccoli florets in 2 tsp of olive oil and season. Arrange on a large baking tray. Brush zucchini slices with olive oil on both sides, season and arrange on the same tray. Coat asparagus spears in 1 tsp of oil, season and place on the baking tray. Roast for about 8 minutes, take the asparagus off the tray if ready, carry on roasting broccoli and zucchini for another 5-7 minutes, until cooked through. Alternatively, you could use a griddle pan if you prefer.
4. STEAM: Bring a large pot of water to the boil and grab a steaming basket. Once the water comes to the boil, steam broccoli for about 5-6 minutes, zucchini slices for about 3 minutes, asparagus for about 3-5 minutes and peas for about 3 minutes. You will need to do the steaming in batches.
5. If you roasted your vegetables, bring a small pot of water to the boil, cook frozen petit pois or peas for about 3 minutes, drain and immediately refresh it under a cold tap to preserve the colour.
6. Heat up 1 tsp of oil in a small frying pan, once warm add almonds. Toast them for a few minutes until golden and slightly plump, moving them around the pan frequently. Sprinkle with flaky salt before removing from the pan. Allow to cool down and chop roughly.

8. Arrange all of the salad elements on a large platter, dress with approximately half of the dressing (keep the rest in the fridge, use up in the next few days) and sprinkle with toasted almonds at the end. Pieces of soft vegan cheese, like this almond feta, scattered on top are also a nice addition."

Prepare ingredients:
- toast almonds
- finely slice fennel

STEP 5
Arrange the halloumi on the plate and finish with the pesto, olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs for garnish. Serve while the halloumi is warm."

Simmer until the sweet potatoes are almost falling apart and the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. The liquid should also be reduced by almost a third.

4. Add the coconut milk and kale to the pot and stir. Place the lid on top and continue to simmer the
stew until the kale is wilted and bright green, about 3-4 minutes. Season the sweet potato and coconut milk stew again with salt and pepper. Bring the stew back up to a strong simmer and check for seasoning. Adjust with more salt, pepper, chili etc. if necessary.

5. Serve the sweet potato and coconut milk stew hot with chopped cilantro, extra chili flakes, lime wedges, and Nigella seeds (if using)."
